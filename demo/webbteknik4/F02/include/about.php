						<p>Dr Otero is interested on theories and conceptual frameworks in HCI, from more traditional approaches taking a user centred perspective to more recent trends focusing on user’s experiences with technologies. In a nutshell, the question driving my research concerns the understanding of how the properties of distinct devices, computational artefacts and embedded external representations impact on people’s activities (from work related activities to educational and ludic contexts). Furthermore, he is also keen on understanding how distinct methodologies suit the investigation of different issues along the artefact design cycle and how the design solutions can the documented and reused by design teams.</p>
